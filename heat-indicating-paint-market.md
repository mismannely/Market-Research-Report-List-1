<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Indicating Paint Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible</li><li>Irreversible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heat indicating paint is categorized into two main types: reversible and irreversible. Reversible paints change color when exposed to heat but revert to their original hue upon cooling, allowing for repeated monitoring of temperature fluctuations. In contrast, irreversible paints undergo a permanent color change when heated, providing a one-time visual indicator of temperature exposure. These characteristics make each type suitable for different applications, such as continuous monitoring in machinery or permanent indication in safety equipment.</p></p>
