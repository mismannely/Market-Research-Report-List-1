<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laminar Flow Chambers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Horizontal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laminar flow chambers are vital for creating sterile environments in laboratories and industrial settings. The market can be classified into two main types: vertical and horizontal laminar flow chambers. Vertical flow chambers have air flowing from the top down, which is ideal for work with larger equipment or in limited spaces. In contrast, horizontal flow chambers direct air horizontally across the workspace, providing a wider surface area for manipulation. Both types ensure minimal contamination, but their design influences usability and application.</p></p>
