<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil & Gas Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravitational</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Oil & Gas Separator market primarily features two types: gravitational and centrifugal separators. Gravitational separators use differences in density to separate oil, gas, and water by allowing fluids to settle at different rates in a vessel, making them efficient for larger volumes. Centrifugal separators, on the other hand, utilize rotational forces to accelerate the separation process, effectively handling emulsions and fine particles. Both types play crucial roles in optimizing resource recovery and enhancing operational efficiency in oil and gas production.</p></p>
