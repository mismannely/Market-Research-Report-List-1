<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Isolation Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Bearings</li><li>Sliding Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The seismic isolation bearings market comprises mainly two types: elastomeric bearings and sliding bearings. Elastomeric bearings use a series of rubber layers molded with steel plates, allowing for flexibility and energy dissipation during an earthquake. They effectively reduce seismic forces transmitted to structures. Sliding bearings, on the other hand, rely on low-friction surfaces that permit horizontal movement, enabling structures to shift relative to ground motion while minimizing damage. Both types enhance building resilience in seismic-prone areas.</p></p>
